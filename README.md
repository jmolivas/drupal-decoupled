# Drupal Decoupled Integrations

## Why Decoupled Drupal
Using Drupal as a headless CMS with a Deoupled front-end implementation is a great way to get an enterprise-quality CMS, paired with a great modern development experience using Remix, Next.js, Astro and/or others.

This repository will provide you with the building blocks to achive this in a simplified way.

### Components

- [Drupal sites](drupal/)
- [Drupal Modules](drupal/modules)
- [Examples](examples)
- [Npm Packages](packages)

It only takes a few steps to use Drupal paired with a Decoupl.
